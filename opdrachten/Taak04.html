<h2 id="it-autobiography">IT-Autobiography</h2>

<p>My name is Jens Van Reusel and I am 17 years old. I study &#8216;IT and Networking&#8217; at the
Immaculata Instituut Oostmalle. IT always has been a big part of my life, let me tell you 
why.</p>

<p>My IT career started back when I was about 5 years old. Me and my daddy used to play 
&#8216;Prince of Persia&#8217; on the computer together. Not the new games but the old 8-bit one on a 
floppy disk, which was in black and white except for the blood and candles. The first time 
using a computer and playing a game gave me an amazing feeling, like it was some sort of 
magic. I guess that&#8217;s why I am a gamer right now. </p>

<p>I became more and more interested in IT because I spent a lot of time with it and continuously 
discovered more features and more stuff to do. 
Sites I visited most as a kid were probably YouTube and sites with those little 
flash games.</p>

<p>At this moment, IT is a big part of my life. I use my computer for my studies and when I am 
done, I use it for pastime activities like gaming or just surfing the web. Even when I am not 
at home, I always have my HTC One smartphone with me and occasionally my tablet. So it 
is pretty safe to say that the majority of my time is IT-related.</p>

<p>The hours spent behind my computer vary from day to day. I would say at least 3 hours a 
day during schooldays. In the weekends, it can be as much as 10 hours a day, if not more.
Most of the time, you will find me experimenting in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects or 
Maxon Cinema 4D. This is when I am not working for school and not gaming. The most 
fascinating part about this is that you can create an epic result from something that is a 
normal or even boring picture or movie, in some cases even from scratch. I have always 
wanted to be really good at this stuff so I began watching tutorials and reading forums and 
blogs. Right now, I&#8217;d say I am pretty good with all the editing but I wouldn&#8217;t consider 
myself an expert yet.</p>

<p>My biggest motivation to study IT is that I have always wanted to be a game developer. Not 
an unknown one like those indie developers but from a major triple A title in a big company 
like Ubisoft or Electronic Arts. The downside is, we live in Belgium so I need to go study 
abroad next year if I want to fullfil my dream. Either way, I&#8217;ll definitely pursue my carreer in the field of IT.</p>

<p>As you have read, IT has become a major part in my life and almost everything I do is 
related to IT in one way or another.</p>
